# Building Modern Apps with Vue 3

Vue 3 has revolutionized how we build frontend applications with its Composition API and improved performance.

## Key Features

### Composition API

The Composition API provides better code organization and reusability:

```javascript
import { ref, computed } from 'vue'

export function useCounter() {
  const count = ref(0)
  const doubled = computed(() => count.value * 2)

  function increment() {
    count.value++
  }

  return { count, doubled, increment }
}
```

### Reactivity System

Vue 3's reactivity is faster and more efficient than ever:

- Better TypeScript support
- Improved tree-shaking
- Smaller bundle sizes

## Why Choose Vue 3?

1. **Gentle learning curve** - Easy for beginners
2. **Powerful features** - Suitable for complex apps
3. **Great ecosystem** - Vue Router, Pinia, Vite
4. **Active community** - Excellent documentation

## Conclusion

Vue 3 is an excellent choice for modern web development, offering the perfect balance between simplicity and power.
